# Contributing

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great. This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

The majority of contributions won't need to touch any Ruby code at all.

## Getting started

Before you can start contributing to Linguist, you'll need to set up your environment first. Clone the repo and run `script/bootstrap` to install its dependencies.

    git clone https://github.com/github/linguist.git
    cd linguist/
    script/bootstrap

To run Linguist from the cloned repository, you will need to generate the code samples first:

    bundle exec rake samples

Run this command each time a [sample][samples] has been modified.

To run Linguist from the cloned repository:

    bundle exec bin/linguist --breakdown

### Dependencies

Linguist uses the [`charlock_holmes`](https://github.com/brianmario/charlock_holmes) character encoding detection library which in turn uses [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/), and the libgit2 bindings for Ruby provided by [`rugged`](https://github.com/libgit2/rugged). These components have their own dependencies - `icu4c`, and `cmake` and `pkg-config` respectively - which you may need to install before you can install Linguist.

For example, on macOS with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install cmake pkg-config icu4c` and on Ubuntu: `apt-get install cmake pkg-config libicu-dev`.

## Adding an extension to a language

We try only to add new extensions once they have some usage on GitHub. In most cases we prefer that extensions be in use in hundreds of repositories before supporting them in Linguist.

To add support for a new extension:

1. Add your extension to the language entry in [`languages.yml`][languages], keeping the extensions in alphabetical and case-sensitive (uppercase before lowercase) order, with the exception of the primary extension; the primary extension should be first.
1. Add at least one sample for your extension to the [samples directory][samples] in the correct subdirectory. We'd prefer examples of real-world code showing common usage. The more representative of the structure of the language, the better.
1. Open a pull request, linking to a [GitHub search result](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=extension%3Aboot+NOT+nothack&type=Code&ref=searchresults) showing in-the-wild usage.  
  If you are adding a sample, please state clearly the license covering the code in the sample, and if possible, link to the original source of the sample.

Additionally, if this extension is already listed in [`languages.yml`][languages] and associated with another language, then sometimes a few more steps will need to be taken:

1. Make sure that example `.yourextension` files are present in the [samples directory][samples] for each language that uses `.yourextension`.
1. Test the performance of the Bayesian classifier with a relatively large number (1000s) of sample `.yourextension` files. (ping **@lildude** to help with this) to ensure we're not misclassifying files.
1. If the Bayesian classifier does a bad job with the sample `.yourextension` files then a [heuristic](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/heuristics.rb) may need to be written to help.


## Adding a language

We try only to add languages once they have some usage on GitHub. In most cases we prefer that each new file extension be in use in hundreds of repositories before supporting them in Linguist.

To add support for a new language:

1. Add an entry for your language to [`languages.yml`][languages]. Omit the `language_id` field for now.
1. Add a syntax-highlighting grammar for your language using: `script/add-grammar https://github.com/JaneSmith/MyGrammar`  
  This command will analyze the grammar and, if no problems are found, add it to the repository. If problems are found, please report them to the grammar maintainer as you will not be able to add the grammar if problems are found.  
  **Please only add grammars that have [one of these licenses][licenses].**
1. Add samples for your language to the [samples directory][samples] in the correct subdirectory.
1. Add a `language_id` for your language using `script/set-language-ids`.  
  **You should only ever need to run `script/set-language-ids --update`. Anything other than this risks breaking GitHub search :cry:**
1. Open a pull request, linking to a [GitHub search results](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=extension%3Aboot+NOT+nothack&type=Code&ref=searchresults) showing in-the-wild usage.  
  Please state clearly the license covering the code in the samples. Link directly to the original source if possible.

In addition, if your new language defines an extension that's already listed in [`languages.yml`][languages] (such as `.foo`) then sometimes a few more steps will need to be taken:

1. Make sure that example `.foo` files are present in the [samples directory][samples] for each language that uses `.foo`.
1. Test the performance of the Bayesian classifier with a relatively large number (1000s) of sample `.foo` files. (ping **@lildude** to help with this) to ensure we're not misclassifying files.
1. If the Bayesian classifier does a bad job with the sample `.foo` files then a [heuristic](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/heuristics.rb) may need to be written to help.

Remember, the goal here is to try and avoid false positives!


## Fixing a misclassified language

Most languages are detected by their file extension defined in [`languages.yml`][languages].  For disambiguating between files with common extensions, Linguist applies some [heuristics](/lib/linguist/heuristics.rb) and a [statistical classifier](lib/linguist/classifier.rb). This process can help differentiate between, for example, `.h` files which could be either C, C++, or Obj-C.

Misclassifications can often be solved by either adding a new filename or extension for the language or adding more [samples][samples] to make the classifier smarter.


## Fixing syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting in GitHub is performed using TextMate-compatible grammars. These are the same grammars that TextMate, Sublime Text and Atom use. Every language in [`languages.yml`][languages] is mapped to its corresponding TextMate `scopeName`. This scope name will be used when picking up a grammar for highlighting.

Assuming your code is being detected as the right language, in most cases syntax highlighting problems are due to a bug in the language grammar rather than a bug in Linguist. [`vendor/README.md`][grammars] lists all the grammars we use for syntax highlighting on GitHub.com. Find the one corresponding to your code's programming language and submit a bug report upstream. If you can, try to reproduce the highlighting problem in the text editor that the grammar is designed for (TextMate, Sublime Text, or Atom) and include that information in your bug report.

You can also try to fix the bug yourself and submit a Pull Request. [TextMate's documentation](https://manual.macromates.com/en/language_grammars) offers a good introduction on how to work with TextMate-compatible grammars. You can test grammars using [Lightshow](https://github-lightshow.herokuapp.com).

Once the bug has been fixed upstream, we'll pick it up for GitHub in the next release of Linguist.


## Changing the source of a syntax highlighting grammar

We'd like to ensure Linguist and GitHub.com are using the latest and greatest grammars that are consistent with the current usage but understand that sometimes a grammar can lag behind the evolution of a language or even stop being developed. This often results in someone grasping the opportunity to create a newer and better and more actively maintained grammar, and we'd love to use it and pass on it's functionality to our users.

Switching the source of a grammar is really easy:

    script/add-grammar --replace MyGrammar https://github.com/PeterPan/MyGrammar

This command will analyze the grammar and, if no problems are found, add it to the repository. If problems are found, please report these problems to the grammar maintainer as you will not be able to add the grammar if problems are found.  

**Please only add grammars that have [one of these licenses][licenses].**

Please then open a pull request for the updated grammar.


## Testing

You can run the tests locally with:

    bundle exec rake test

Sometimes getting the tests running can be too much work, especially if you don't have much Ruby experience. It's okay: be lazy and let our build bot [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/#!/github/linguist) run the tests for you. Just open a pull request and the bot will start cranking away.

Here's our current build status: [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/github/linguist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/linguist)

## Maintainers

Linguist is maintained with :heart: by:

- **@Alhadis**
- **@BenEddy** (GitHub staff)
- **@Caged** (GitHub staff)
- **@grantr** (GitHub staff)
- **@kivikakk** (GitHub staff)
- **@larsbrinkhoff**
- **@lildude** (GitHub staff)
- **@pchaigno**
- **@rafer** (GitHub staff)
- **@shreyasjoshis** (GitHub staff)

As Linguist is a production dependency for GitHub we have a couple of workflow restrictions:

- Anyone with commit rights can merge Pull Requests provided that there is a :+1: from a GitHub staff member.
- Releases are performed by GitHub staff so we can ensure GitHub.com always stays up to date with the latest release of Linguist and there are no regressions in production.
