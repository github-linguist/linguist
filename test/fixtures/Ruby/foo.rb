# This file is used to test the Linguist language detection capabilities.
# It should be detected as Ruby based on its extension and content.
# The file is intentionally simple to ensure it does not contain complex logic.
# You can add more Ruby code here if needed for further testing.
# The purpose of this file is to serve as a fixture for testing the Linguist library.
# It should not be executed in a production environment.
# Ensure that this file is saved with the .rb extension to be recognized as Ruby code.
