== Licence

This software is available under three licences: the GNU GPL version 2 (or at
your option, a later version), the Perl Artistic License, or the MIT License.
The licence preferred by me is the MIT licence.

The original Perl MIME::Types was dually originally licensed with the Perl
Artistic Licence and the GNU GPL ("the same terms as Perl itself") and given
that the Ruby implementation originally hewed pretty closely to the Perl
version, I chose to maintain the additional licensing terms.
