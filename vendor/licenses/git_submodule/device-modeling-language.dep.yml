    and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\nin Section 2.1.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n-------------------\n\n3.1.
    Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source
    Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute,
    must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the
    Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense,
    and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter
    or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution
    of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a)
    such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as
    described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable
    Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means
    in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to
    the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms
    of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n
    \   license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the
    recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution
    of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of
    Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License
    for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware
    with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software
    is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally
    distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s),
    so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute
    the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.
    Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including
    copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of
    liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except
    that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known
    factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose
    to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability
    obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do
    so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make
    it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability
    obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor
    for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity
    or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty
    and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to
    Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf
    it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with
    respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order,
    or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the
    maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect.
    Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions
    of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by
    statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient
    of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1.
    The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail
    to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights
    granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally,
    unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,
    and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance
    by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance.
    Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing
    basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
    means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with
    this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days
    after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against
    any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
    actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly
    or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and
    all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall
    terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above,
    all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave
    been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to
    termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*

    non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *\n*  quality and performance of
    the Covered Software is with You.        *\n*  Should any Covered Software prove
    defective in any respect, You     *\n*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost
    of any necessary servicing,   *\n*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of

    \ Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *\n*  (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *\n*  Contributor, or
    anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *\n*  permitted above, be
    liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *\n*  special, incidental, or
    consequential damages of any character      *\n*  including, without limitation,
    damages for lost profits, loss of    *\n*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure
    or malfunction, or any    *\n*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even
    if such party      *\n*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages.
    This   *\n*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
    \  *\n*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *\n*
    \ extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *\n*  jurisdictions
    do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *\n*  incidental or consequential
    damages, so this exclusion and          *\n*  limitation may not apply to You.

    of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction,
    without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\nNothing in this Section
    shall prevent a party's ability to bring\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9.
    Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement
    concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held
    to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary
    to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language
