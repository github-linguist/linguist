    in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the

    below).\n\n      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
    Object\n      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which

    \     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n
    \     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n

    the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any
    patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n

    all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the
    Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain
    to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
    a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
    Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
    notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
    that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
    one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n
    \         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
    if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated
    by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
    only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
    \         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or
    as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such
    additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the
    License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
    and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
    \     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for
    any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated
    in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
    Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n
    \     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
    license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n
    \  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as
    required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the
    Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides
    the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\"
    BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n
    \     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of
    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using
    or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise
    of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event
    and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
    or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
    grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
    \     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result
    of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including
    but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses),
    even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n
    \  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a
    fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting
    such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You
    agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
    liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
    reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n

    In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
    contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
    and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,

    In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
    contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
    and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,

    or\n    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n    copyright

    includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n        distribution, then any

    appear. The contents\n        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
    only and\n        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
    \       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n        or
    as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n        that such additional
    attribution notices cannot be construed\n        as modifying the License.\n\n

    complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n 5. Submission of
    Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally
    submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under
    the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or
    conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or

    provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
    CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n    implied, including, without limitation,

    the\n    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n
    \   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether
    in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by
    applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed
    to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including
    any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any
    character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability
    to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n
    \   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other
    commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised
    of the possibility of such damages.\n\n 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
    While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
    to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n
    \   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License.
    However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf
    and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor,
    and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless
    for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
    by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n

    included in or attached to the work\n      (an example is provided in the Appendix
    below).\n\n      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
    Object\n      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
    the\n      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n
    \     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n
    \     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n
    \     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n
    \     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean
    any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and
    any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof,
    that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by
    the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
    on behalf of\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
    \"submitted\"\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
    sent\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited
    to\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n
    \     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n      Licensor
    for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n      excluding communication
    that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n      designated in writing by the
    copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n      \"Contributor\" shall mean
    Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution
    has been received by Licensor and\n      subsequently incorporated within the
    Work.\n\n   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
    of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n      publicly display, publicly perform,
    sublicense, and distribute the\n      Work and such Derivative Works in Source
    or Object form.\n\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions
    of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in
    this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell,
    import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only
    to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n
    \     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute
    patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim
    in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within
    the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any
    patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
    \     as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may
    reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof
    in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form,
    provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must
    give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of
    this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent
    notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must
    retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute,
    all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the
    Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain
    to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
    a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
    Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
    notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
    that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
    one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n
    \         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
    if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated
    by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
    only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
    \         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or
    as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such
    additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the
    License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
    and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
    \     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for
    any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated
    in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
    Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n
    \     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
    license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n
    \  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as
    required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the
    Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides
    the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\"
    BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n
    \     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of
    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using
    or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise
    of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event
    and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
    or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
    grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
    \     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result
    of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including
    but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses),
    even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n
    \  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a
    fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting
    such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You
    agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
    liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
    reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n
    \  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License
    to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n
    \     boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced
    with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The

    of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License,
    as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n      \n\n      &quot;Derivative
    Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based

    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under
    this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n

    notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following
    places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works;
    within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
    Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever
    such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are
    for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your
    own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
    attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.\n\n      You
    may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional
    or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution
    of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your
    use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
    stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly
    state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
    Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,

    may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks.
    This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service
    marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content
    of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
    law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
    provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
    OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
    any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness
    of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
    exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.
    In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
    contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
    and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
    or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
    or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
    for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
    all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised
    of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional
    Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
    choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
    in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
    sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
    to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
    by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any
    such warranty or additional liability. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX:

    In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
    contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
    and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,

    of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event
    and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
    or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
    grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n

    but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses),
    even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n
    \  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a
    fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting

    and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
    otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
    acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
    including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages

    AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1. Definitions.\n\n
    \     \n\n      \"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

    source, and configuration files.\n\n      \n\n      \"Object\" form shall mean
    any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form,
    including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
    conversions to other media types.\n\n      \n\n      \"Work\" shall mean the work
    of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License,
    as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n      \n\n      \"Derivative
    Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on
    (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
    elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of
    authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include
    works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces
    of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \n\n      \"Contribution\"
    shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work
    and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that
    is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
    owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the
    copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\" means any
    form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its
    representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
    lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed
    by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving
    the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n      \n\n
    \     \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
    behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
    within the Work.\n\n   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and
    conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license
    to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
    sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
    form.\n\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
    license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by
    such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone
    or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)
    was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including
    a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution
    incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
    then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
    terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You
    may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in
    any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
    that You meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients
    of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must
    cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the
    files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative
    Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
    from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain
    to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\"
    text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
    must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such
    NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
    Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
    Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License.
    You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
    alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
    additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.\n\n
    \     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
    additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
    distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
    provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
    with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.
    Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
    for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
    conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n
    \  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
    for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing
    the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required
    by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
    OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
    any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness
    of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
    exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability.
    In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
    contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
    and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
    or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
    or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
    for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
    all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised
    of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional
    Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
    choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
    in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
    sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
    to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
    by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any
    such warranty or additional liability. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX:

    3.0.5 - CC0-1.0\nhttps://github.com/shinnn/spdx-license-ids#readme\n\n\nCreative
    Commons Legal Code\n\nCC0 1.0 Universal CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A
    LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES
    NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
    ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE
    OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS
    LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION
    OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions
    throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
    (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\")
    of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\nCertain
    owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of
    contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\"Commons\")
    that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement
    build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely
    as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
    commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the
    ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
    works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through
    the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations,
    and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
    associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is
    an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply
    CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge
    of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended
    legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A
    Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring
    rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include,
    but are not limited to, the following:\n\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt,
    distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n\n      ii.
    moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n      iii.
    publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted
    in a Work;\n\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
    to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n      v. rights
    protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n\n
    \     vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection
    of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended
    or successor version of such directive); and\n\n      vii. other similar, equivalent
    or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty,
    and any national implementations thereof.\n\n   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent
    permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly,
    fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders
    all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
    of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future
    claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii)
    for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
    time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver
    for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of
    Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
    subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal
    or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as
    contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n   3. Public License
    Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid
    or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the
    maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
    In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
    affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
    irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related
    Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
    provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
    in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
    purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
    purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date
    CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
    reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial
    invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
    and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise
    any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert
    any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either
    case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n   4. Limitations
    and Disclaimers.\n\n      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are
    waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n
    \     b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
    of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
    without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
    purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
    or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
    extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n      c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility
    for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
    including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
    permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n      d. Affirmer
    understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document
    and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nspdx-exceptions

    OR \"LICENSE\"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.
    ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW

    AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE
    MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
    HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n   1.
    Definitions\n\n      a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon
    the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative
    work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
    or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other
    form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
    form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes
    a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
    For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram,
    the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\")
    will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n\n      b.
    \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias
    and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or
    subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason
    of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations,
    in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one
    or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
    in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above)
    for the purposes of this License.\n\n      c. \"Distribute\" means to make available
    to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate,
    through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n      d. \"Licensor\" means the
    individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms
    of this License.\n\n      e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary
    or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
    the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
    addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers,
    and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise
    perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case
    of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the
    sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts,
    the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\n      f. \"Work\" means the
    literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including
    without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
    whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such
    as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work
    or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
    cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous
    to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving
    or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by
    a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map,
    plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture
    or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to
    the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety
    or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or
    artistic work.\n\n      g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights
    under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor
    to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n      h.
    \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate
    to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by
    wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the
    public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from
    a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the
    public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances
    of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast
    the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n      i. \"Reproduce\"
    means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by
    sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations
    of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital
    form or other electronic medium.\n\n   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this
    License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright
    or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection
    with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n
    \  3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
    hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
    duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
    as stated below:\n\n      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
    one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\n
    \     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
    demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
    example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from
    English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has
    been modified.\";\n\n      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
    as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform
    Adaptations.\n\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n         i. Non-waivable
    Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect
    royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
    the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
    by You of the rights granted under this License;\n\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory
    License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
    through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor
    waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
    the rights granted under this License; and,\n\n         iii. Voluntary License
    Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually
    or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
    voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the
    rights granted under this License.\n\n   The above rights may be exercised in
    all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
    include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
    the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
    expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n   4. Restrictions. The
    license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
    the following restrictions:\n\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform
    the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or
    the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
    Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient
    of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
    the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
    that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
    of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the
    Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
    the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section
    4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
    the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
    the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
    4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
    required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n\n      b. If You Distribute, or Publicly
    Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request
    has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
    the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or
    if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
    a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution
    Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
    means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied;
    (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies
    to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
    notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section
    3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
    the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or
    \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required
    by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
    that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
    appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as
    the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
    may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License,
    You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship
    or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
    written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n
    \     c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
    permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
    the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must
    not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the
    Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
    would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
    action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor
    will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise
    Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but
    not otherwise.\n\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n   UNLESS
    OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK
    AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,
    EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
    OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
    OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
    OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
    OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n   6. Limitation
    on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
    LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
    PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
    EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   7.
    Termination\n\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals
    or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
    however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
    entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
    and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n      b. Subject to the
    above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration
    of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor
    reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will
    not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
    continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n   8.
    Miscellaneous\n\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
    or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on
    the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n
    \     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions
    as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n      c. If any provision
    of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
    affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
    and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall
    be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n
    \     d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
    party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the
    entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
    are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work
    not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You.\n\n      e. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n      f.
    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were
    drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
    Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention
    of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24,
    1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction
    in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
    provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable
    national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright
    law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional
    rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended
    to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons
    Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
    whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to
    You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without
    limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in
    connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if
    Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
    shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose
    of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative
    Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative

    License.\n\nCreative Commons may be contacted at http://creativecommons.org/.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nabbrev

    below).\n\n      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
    Object\n      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
    the\n      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n
    \     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n
    \     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n
    \     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n
    \     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean
    any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and

    of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide,

    infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n
    \     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute
    patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim
    in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within
    the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any
    patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
    \     as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may

    notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must

    all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the
    Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain
    to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
    a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
    Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
    notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
    that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
    one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n
    \         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
    if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated
    by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
    only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
    \         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or
    as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such
    additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the
    License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
    and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
    \     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for
    any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated
    in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
    Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n
    \     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
    license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n
    \  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as
    required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the
    Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides
    the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\"
    BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n
    \     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of
    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using
    or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise
    of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event
    and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
    or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
    grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
    \     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result
    of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including
    but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses),
    even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n
    \  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a
    fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting
    such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You
    agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
    liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
    reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n
    \  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License
    to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n
    \     boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced
