## Section I: PREAMBLE

Multimodal generative models are being widely adopted and used, and have the potential to transform the way artists, among other individuals, conceive and benefit from AI or ML technologies as a tool for content creation.

Notwithstanding the current and potential benefits that these artifacts can bring to society at large, there are also concerns about potential misuses of them, either due to their technical limitations or ethical considerations.

In short, this License strives for both the open and not commercial purpose: so, Pylar Documents, does not allow: use for commercial or endorse. When it comes to the open character, we took inspiration from open source but not to permit or grant of IP rights to anyone. Referring to the downstream responsible use, we added use-based restrictions "Use Restrictions" section.

In terms of publishing always must be for non commercial and endorse porpuse:

- Pylar Documents.
- the in-process results of Pylar Documents.
- the end results of Pylar Documents.
  and always limited to scientific and research demonstrations via twitter with the "@miguelgargallo" "#PylarAI" tags or "@miguelgargallo.es" tag and description keyword on Instragam.

At the same time, we strive to promote open and responsible research on generative models for art and science, both: research and science for not commercial or endorese content generation.

Downstream derivative versions of Pylar Documents could not be released. We believe in the intersection between open and responsible AI development; thus, this License aims to strike a balance between both in order to enable responsible open-science publishing results, in the field of AI and not commercial or endorse.
This License governs the use of Pylar Documents and is informed by Pylar Documents card associated with Pylar Documents.

## Section II: OVERVIEW

Pylar AI creative ML is a license designed to govern the use of multimodal generative models and related documents (referred to as "Pylar Documents" in this License). These models have the potential to transform the way artists and other individuals conceive and benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies as a tool for content creation.

While there are many potential benefits to society from the use of these models, there are also concerns about potential misuses, whether due to technical limitations or ethical considerations. This License therefore strives to balance the open and non-commercial nature of Pylar Documents, while also promoting responsible research and use of generative models for art and science.

## Section III: PERMISSIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Under this License, the following permissions are granted for the use of Pylar Documents:

    Private use: Pylar Documents may be used for personal, non-commercial purposes.
    Science and research publications: Pylar Documents may be used in scientific and research publications, as long as they are not used for commercial or endorsement purposes.
    Non-commercial publications: Pylar Documents may be used in non-commercial publications, as long as they are not used for endorsement purposes.
    Modification for pull requests: Pylar Documents may be modified for the purpose of creating pull requests, as long as the modifications are made within the Official Sources (as defined in Section VIII) and are not used for endorsement purposes.

The following limitations apply to the use of Pylar Documents:

    Commercial use: Pylar Documents may not be used for commercial purposes.
    Endorsement: Pylar Documents may not be used for endorsement purposes.
    Liability: The creators and owners of Pylar Documents are not liable for any damages resulting from the use of Pylar Documents.
    Distribution: Pylar Documents may not be distributed without the written permission of the creators and owners.
    Warranty: Pylar Documents are provided "as is" without any warranty.
    Modification to endorse: Pylar Documents may not be modified for the purpose of endorsement.
    Modification for pull requests outside of Official Sources: Prohibited. This means that you are not allowed to modify the Pylar Documents or any Derivatives of the Pylar Documents for the purpose of making a pull request outside of the designated Official Sources, as defined in the License. This is in order to ensure that all modifications to the Pylar Documents are properly documented and can be easily tracked and traced by the Owners.

NOW THEREFORE, You and Licensor agree as follows:
