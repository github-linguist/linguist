description: A permissive, OSI- and FSF-approved, GPL-compatible license, expressly allowing attribution with just a copyright notice and a short form link rather than the full text of the license.  Includes an express grant of patent rights.  Licensed works and modifications may be distributed under different terms and without source code, and the patent grant may also optionally be expanded to larger works to permit use as a contributor license agreement.

how: Insert the license or a link to it along with a copyright notice into your source file(s), and/or create a text file (typically named LICENSE or LICENSE.txt) in the root of your source code and copy the text of the license into the file, replacing [year] with the current year and [fullname] with the name (or names) of the copyright holders.

note: It is recommended to add a link to the license and copyright notice at the top of each source file, example text can be found at https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl/.
