description: A permissive license lets people do anything with your code with proper attribution and without warranty. The ISC license is functionally equivalent to the <a href="/licenses/bsd-2-clause/">BSD 2-Clause</a> and <a href="/licenses/mit/">MIT</a> licenses, removing some language that is no longer necessary.

how: Create a text file (typically named LICENSE or LICENSE.txt) in the root of your source code and copy the text of the license into the file. Replace [year] with the current year and [fullname] with the name (or names) of the copyright holders.
