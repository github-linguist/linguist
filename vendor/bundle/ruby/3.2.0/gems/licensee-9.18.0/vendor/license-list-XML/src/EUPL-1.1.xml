                 Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy
                 of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes
                 or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository

                 limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of
                 the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.</p>

                Obligations of the Licensee
                <p>The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed
                 on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:</p>
                <p>Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and
                 all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must
                 include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she
                 distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry
                 prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.</p>
                <p>Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or
                 Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be
                 done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original
                 Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming
                 Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative
                 Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.</p>
                <p>Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies
                 thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible
                 Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible
                 Licence. For the sake of this clause, "Compatible Licence," refers to the licences listed in
                 the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible
                 Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the
                 Compatible Licence shall prevail.</p>
                <p>Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee
                 will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this
                 Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute
                 and/or communicate the Work.</p>
                <p>Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
                 service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use
                 in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.</p>

                Chain of Authorship
                <p>The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned
                 by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the
                 Licence.</p>
                <p>Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are
                 owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant
                 the Licence.</p>
                <p>Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a
                 licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.</p>

                Disclaimer of Warranty
                <p>The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is
                 not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or "bugs" inherent to this type of
                 software development.</p>
                <p>For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an "as is" basis and without
                 warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability,
                 fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of
                 intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.</p>
                <p>This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of
                 any rights to the Work.</p>

            <item>
                <bullet>8.</bullet>
                Disclaimer of Liability
                <p>Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the
                 Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of
                 any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation,
                 damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or
                 any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
                 damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far
                 such laws apply to the Work.</p>

            <item>

                Additional agreements
                <p>While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an
                 additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                 indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence.
                 However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole
                 responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if
                 You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
                 by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such
                 warranty or additional liability.</p>

                 persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.</p>

                <p>The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this
