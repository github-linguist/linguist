      <p>Preamble</p>
      <p>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified,
         distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic

      <p>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright
         Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
         make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing
         arrangement.</p>

              make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under

            </item>
               <item>

                a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified
                   Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
                   received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works
                   derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but
                   Distributor Fees are allowed.

          You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you
             include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such
             instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any
             time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new
             instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or
             cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are
             invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>(6)</bullet>
          You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you

             packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing
             fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components
             in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution
             of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>(8)</bullet>
          You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package
             in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of
             applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided
             the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
        </item>
      </list>

      <p>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version</p>
      <list>
        <item>
            <bullet>(9)</bullet>
          Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the
             Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such
             works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this
             license.

      <p>General Provisions</p>
      <list>
        <item>
            <bullet>(10)</bullet>
          Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this
             Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do
             not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>(11)</bullet>
          If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you,
             you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the
             requirements of this license.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>(12)</bullet>
          This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo
             of the Copyright Holder.

        <item>
            <bullet>(13)</bullet>
          This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have
             made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
             patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the
             Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against
             any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
             then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is
             filed.
