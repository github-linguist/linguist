      <p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>
      <p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other
         rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
         and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
         informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
      <p>Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the
         public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights.
         Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the
         license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
         applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly
         mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other <alt match="CC-[ \t\r\n\f]{0,10}licensed" name="ccLicensed"/> material, or material
         used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors<alt match=":[ \t\r\n\f]{1,10}wiki\.creativecommons\.org/Considerations_for_licensors|\." name="considerationsLicensors">: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors</alt></p>
      <p>Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public
         permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s
         permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or
         limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
         permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
         the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have
         copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that
         all changes be marked or described.</p>
      <p>Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

          </item>
          <item>

            if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which
               You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis
               Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for
               purposes of Section 3(b); and

          <item>
            <bullet>a.</bullet>
            Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor
               offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or
               warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied,
               statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title,
               merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or
               other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or
               discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this
               disclaimer may not apply to You.
          </item>
          <item>
            <bullet>b.</bullet>
            To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory
               (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special,
               indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs,
               expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material,
               even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses,
               or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this
               limitation may not apply to You.
          </item>
          <item>
            <bullet>c.</bullet>
            The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted
               in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer
               and waiver of all liability.

              automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days
                 of Your discovery of the violation; or
            </item>
               <item>

            For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate
               terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing
               so will not terminate this Public License.

            For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to,
               reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that
               could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.

          <item>
            <bullet>b.</bullet>
            To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it
               shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If
               the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
               affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
