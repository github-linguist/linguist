      <titleText>CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Permissive</titleText>
      <p>Preamble</p>
      <p>CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three variants: this licence, CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN- OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).</p>
      <p>The CERN-OHL-P is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in unmodified form only.</p>
      <p>Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.</p>

New versions will be published with a unique version number and a variant identifier specifying the variant. If the Licensor has specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be treated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific version of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same variant identifier published by CERN.</item>
            <item><bullet>7.4</bullet> This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.</item>
