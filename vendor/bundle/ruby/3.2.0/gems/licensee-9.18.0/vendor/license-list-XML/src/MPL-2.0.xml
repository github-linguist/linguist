            <p>Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
                 warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without
                 limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit
                 for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and
                 performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
                 defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary
                 servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
                 part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License
                 except under this disclaimer.

            <p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence),
                 contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered
                 Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special,
                 incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
                 damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
                 malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
                 shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of
                 liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
                 such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
                 Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
                 consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
