# Additional types to add to MIME::Types
#
# MIME types are used to set the Content-Type of raw binary blobs. All text
# blobs are served as text/plain regardless of their type to ensure they
# open in the browser rather than downloading.
#
# The encoding helps determine whether a file should be treated as plain
# text or binary. By default, a mime type's encoding is base64 (binary).
# These types will show a "View Raw" link. To force a type to render as
# plain text, set it to 8bit for UTF-8. text/* types will be treated as
# text by default.
#
#   <type> @<extensions> :<encoding>
#
# type       - mediatype/subtype
# extensions - comma seperated extension list
# encoding   - base64 (binary), 7bit (ASCII), 8bit (UTF-8), or
#              quoted-printable (Printable ASCII).
#
# Follows same format as mime-types data file
#   https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/blob/master/lib/mime/types.rb.data
#
# Any additions or modifications (even trivial) should have corresponding
# test change in `test/test_mime.rb`.
