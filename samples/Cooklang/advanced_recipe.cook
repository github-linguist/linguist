===== Nut roll ======

Add @sugar{1%tbsp} and @yeast{15%g} to the warm @milk{250%ml}.
Mix well until the yeast is fully dissolved.

> This recipe is reconstruction of my grandma's recipes,
> I tried to reduce sugar amount though.

Add @flour{5%tbsp} from the total amount and whisk the mixture
into a batter-like consistency, similar to pancake batter.
Cover with a #towel{} and place in a warm place for ~{30%minutes}.

The dough should rise, and bubbles will form on the surface.

Add @egg{1}, @sugar{100%g}, @vanilla sugar{1%packet}, and
melted @butter{50%g} to the mixture. Whisk thoroughly.

Gradually add the rest of the @flour{495%g} in two stages and
knead the dough.

Knead for ~{10-15%minutes}. Cover the dough and place it
in a warm place for ~{1.5%hours}

== Fillings ==

Grind the stuff. Mix them together.

== Assembly ==

Divide the dough into two equal pieces.

Dust the surface with flour and roll the dough into a rectangle
about 0.5 cm thick.

Generously spread the nut filling over the dough, distributing it
evenly. Leave an empty space along the edges so the roll seals properly.

Carefully roll the dough into a log, pressing it firmly to
avoid air pockets.

Place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

Roll out the second piece of dough and form another roll in
the same way.

Cover the rolls with a towel and let them rest for 20 minutes.

Then brush them with @egg yolk{1} and bake in a preheated oven
 at 170Â°C for ~{50-60%minutes}.
