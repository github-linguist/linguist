DESCRIPTION	roff____
formats text according to control lines embedded
in the text in file918, ... .
Encountering a nonexistent file terminates printing.
The optional argument "+_number" causes printing
to begin at the first page
with that number.
The optional argument
"-s__" causes printing to stop before each page
including the first
to allow paper manipulation;
printing is resumed upon
receipt of an interrupt signal.
The optional argument
"-h" causes the output to contain
horizontal tabs for two or more spaces
that end on a tab stop.
An interrupt signal received during printing terminates all
printing.
Incoming interconsole messages are turned off during printing,
and the original message acceptance state is restored upon
termination.

At the present time, there
