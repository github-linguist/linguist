# The `RackApplication` class is responsible for managing a
# [Nack](http://josh.github.com/nack/) pool for a given Rack
# application. Incoming HTTP requests are dispatched to
# `RackApplication` instances by an `HttpServer`, where they are
# subsequently handled by a pool of Nack worker processes. By default,
# Pow tells Nack to use a maximum of two worker processes per
# application, but this can be overridden with the configuration's
# `workers` option.
#
# Before creating the Nack pool, Pow executes the `.powrc` and
# `.powenv` scripts if they're present in the application root,
# captures their environment variables, and passes them along to the
# Nack worker processes. This lets you modify your `RUBYOPT` to use
# different Ruby options, for example.
#
# If [rvm](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) is installed and an
# `.rvmrc` file is present in the application's root, Pow will load
# both before creating the Nack pool. This makes it easy to run an
# app with a specific version of Ruby.
#
# Nack workers remain running until they're killed, restarted (by
# touching the `tmp/restart.txt` file in the application root), or
# until the application has not served requests for the length of time
# specified in the configuration's `timeout` option (15 minutes by
# default).
