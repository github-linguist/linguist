00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.239
<v Scientist>Good evening, please state your name, age and weight.

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Felix>Felix Nast, age 41 years, 58 kilos.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.439
<v Ulrich>Ulrich Shultz, age 29, 71 kilos.

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:03.260
<v Hanz>Hanz Berlitz, age 19, 68 kilos.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Scientist>Very good.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Scientist>You gentlemen are about to undergo an experiment
that will benefit the soldiers of the Soviet Union.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.709
<v Scientist>You will be given a gas that our nations leading
scientists have been working on.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.769
<v Scientist>All we know is that it is not lethal and you
will be in no physical harm throughout the

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.760
<v Scientist>duration of the experiment.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.819
<v Scientist>Upon completion of this experiment.

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.129
<v Scientist>You will be granted your freedom and returned
to your homeland.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Scientist>Do you comply?

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.720
<v Scientist>Reminder, those who do not comply will be
immediately executed for your crimes against

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.400
<v Scientist>humanity and the Soviet Union.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.700
<v Scientist>I'll ask you once more gentlemen, do you comply?

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.060
<v Scientist>Very good.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.180
<v Scientist>We will administer the gas in a few moments.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Scientist>Please, get acquainted with your new home.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.510
<v Scientist>You will all notice that you have enough food
for the duration of the experiment.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.400
<v Scientist>You will find comfort on the floor as you
had in your cell.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.080
<v Scientist>Books for entertainment, a toilet for the obvious.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Scientist>Also, no one will be entering the room once
the gas has been released so it is up to you

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Scientist>to keep your living quarters, liveable.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Scientist>The gas has been administered.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Felix>Sure is different on the other side of the gas.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Scientist>Day one, the first batch of gas has been released.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.600
<v Scientist>Normal behaviour resumes.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.600
<v Felix>Boy, your name is Hanz?

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.560
<v Hanz>Yes.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.760
<v Felix>Well Hanz, it is so nice to see the face of
the boy who has been crying in the cell next

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.840
<v Felix>to me the past three months.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Felix>Oh come on now, don't you think we should
all be friends while we are here?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:12.000
<v Felix>Let me guess, your father was a good hard
working man taken too soon.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.560
<v Felix>Your mother was a housekeeper.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:24.640
<v Felix>And you were the youngest of four children,
the runt of the pack.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.840
<v Felix>You joined the war to prove something of yourself
only to end up a victim of circumstance.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.680
<v Felix>Am I right?

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Hanz>I was the youngest of three children.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.600
<v Felix>Ah, I was close.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:49.600
<v Felix>What about you, Ulrich is it?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Felix>Well Hanz, I will tell you my story if you
tell me yours.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Hanz>Ok.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:10.030
<v Felix>Well, I was a top SS scientist specialising
in information extraction and experimentation.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.170
<v Felix>I took great pride in my work.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.880
<v Felix>It was almost therapeutic.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.020
<v Felix>I can still see the faces of the men.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Felix>I extracted fingernails, teeth.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.960
<v Felix>How quickly they would rat out their own families
to save their lives.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.920
<v Felix>Ah, such lowly dogs.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.840
<v Felix>Your turn.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.600
<v Hanz>I was stationed just outside of Berlin.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.930
<v Hanz>I didn't see much of the war, just the end of it.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Hanz>I was appointed guard duty one night,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:15.250
<v Hanz>and I was supposed to stay awake for the
duration of the night, but I fell asleep.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:26.200
<v Hanz>When I awoke, everyone was slaughtered.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:41.320
<v Hanz>I ran as fast and as far as I could but they
caught me. Took me to a prison where I sat

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:47.160
<v Hanz>for three months until I ended up here.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.840
<v Felix>I thought as much.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Hanz>Whats your story?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.680
<v Scientist>The gas has been active for four days, and
although none of them have slept for the past

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.320
<v Scientist>four days, normal behaviour resumes.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.920
<v Scientist>The gas seems to be quite effective.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Felix>These anatomy books are embarrassingly inaccurate.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.880
<v Felix>It is no wonder these Russians are so barbaric.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Felix>They killed your father, didn't they?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.500
<v Felix><lang de>Bitte!</lang>

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.220
<v Scientist><i>Ulrich Shultz!</i>

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.220
<v Hanz>Ulrich!

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.080
<v Scientist><i>Put Felix Nast down now or we will end
the experiment and you will be shot!</i>

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.700
<v Hanz>Stop this or they will shoot you!

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Ulrich>You talk too much.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.500
<v Hanz>Ulrich!

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Scientist>The gas has been active for seven days.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Scientist>Normal behaviour resumes outside of the
outburst on day four.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.100
<v Scientist>The men have still yet to sleep.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.640
<v Scientist>Time for some personal business.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Hanz>Hey, what happened the other day?

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.000
<v Ulrich>I almost killed Felix.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.380
<v Ulrich>What's happened with you?

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.240
<v Hanz>You know what I mean.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.000
<v Hanz>No one intervened.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.340
<v Hanz>No one stopped you.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.640
<v Hanz>You just, you just looked at the wall and
dropped him.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Hanz>What did you see?

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.920
<v Hanz>Look, at least tell me your story.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.660
<v Hanz>Everyone's got a story.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:34.820
<v Ulrich>I was a soldier, and like you,
not a very good one.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:46.220
<v Ulrich>I wasn't cruel in what I did but what I
stood for was damning enough, I suppose.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:53.220
<v Ulrich>What we all stood for was damning enough.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.140
<v Ulrich>I was stationed at a camp, a labour camp.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.240
<v Ulrich>My father was the commanding officer of the
camp.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:13.940
<v Ulrich>He was a good man as I remember from my
childhood, but something… changed in him.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:23.880
<v Ulrich>I went to his office one day to deliver a
daily report.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:32.560
<v Ulrich>I opened the door and he had his back turned to me.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:39.580
<v Ulrich>I called to him but he didn't answer.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:49.640
<v Ulrich>He just put the barrel of his Luger and he…

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:02.920
<v Ulrich>If there was one thing I could have
asked him it would be why?

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:12.280
<v Ulrich>Was it fear, was it remorse, was it grief?

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.320
<v Ulrich>That's why I tried…

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Hanz>Ulrich, I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.340
<v Hanz>I haven't slept in days.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.520
<v Ulrich>None of us have.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.060
<v Ulrich>It must be what the gas does.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.140
<v Ulrich>It keeps you awake.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.060
<v Ulrich>They're going to use it on their soldiers
so they don't require sleep.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Hanz>I can't do this anymore.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.540
<v Hanz>I can't breathe in my own skin.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.639
<v Hanz>I have to get out of here.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:07.360
<v Ulrich>Just think of your freedom, that's
what's keeping me going.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:17.560
<v Hanz>You really think we'll be gifted freedom after this?

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.820
<v Scientist>Day 12, Hanz has been screaming for the past 7 hours.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.600
<v Scientist>What seems strange is that the other
men have not reacted in anyway.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.000
<v Scientist>Hanz has been screaming now for the past 12 hours.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.640
<v Scientist>His screams have been replaced with a faint
whimper. It seems he has permanently destroyed

00:15:56.649 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Scientist>his vocal cords.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:10.220
<v Scientist>Sleep Experiment day 12 June 14th 1945, end log.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.520
<v Scientist>Ah, Felix.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.803
<v Scientist>You've come to say hello?

00:16:25.803 --> 00:16:27.603
<v Scientist><i>Felix, Felix, Felix…</i>

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.580
<v Scientist>What are you thinking Felix?

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:55.360
<v Scientist>That's why you're in there, and I'm out here.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.600
<v Scientist><i>Felix, Felix, Felix…</i>

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.240
<v Scientist>Sleep Experiment, day 15.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.060
<v Scientist>Day 15…

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.180
<v Scientist>Sleep Experiment.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.080
<v Scientist>Felix! I demand the papers removed from the window!

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.100
<v Scientist>Felix!

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.680
<v Scientist>Remove the paper!

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.020
<v Scientist>Felix!

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:34.800
<v Scientist>Day 15, Felix has covered the port window
with paper from the book in what appears to

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Scientist>be his own excrement.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.780
<v Scientist>Strange noises have been coming from inside
the cell, but the oxygen levels show that the

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Scientist>men are still awake and alive.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.840
<v Scientist>I'm not sure how much longer the experiment can go on.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:56.960
<v Scientist>Experiment day 15, June 17th 1945.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.440
<v Scientist><i>Gentlemen, the experiment is over.</i>

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.860
<v Scientist><i>We are turning off the gas and opening the chamber.</i>

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.700
<v Scientist>Stand back against the wall or you will be shot.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.760
<v Scientist>Upon examination you will be freed.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Felix>We no longer wish to be freed.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Scientist><i>Day 20 of the Sleep Experiment.</i>

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:59.540
<v Scientist><i>Upon opening the chamber it became clear the
level of mental damage caused by the gas.</i>

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.820
<v Scientist><i>The men have ripped into their own flesh.</i>

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Scientist><i>The amount of blood lost by the three
men should have killed them all.</i>

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.060
<v Scientist><i>Hanz was rushed to the emergency room.</i>

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.900
<v Scientist><i>He tried to utter words but his torn vocal
cords allowed only a weak whisper.</i>

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:27.840
<v Scientist><i>After fighting to stay awake under the anaesthesia,
he died on the operating table,</i>

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.720
<v Scientist><i>11:45 PM.</i>

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:37.400
<v Scientist><i>Felix was sent to the emergency room. He begged
to be put back on the gas and screamed in</i>

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:43.620
<v Scientist><i>agonising pain when we brought the anaesthesia
anywhere near him.</i>

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.520
<v Scientist><i>We then attempted the surgery without it.</i>

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.400
<v Scientist><i>He died the second his eyes closed from fatigue,</i>

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.700
<v Scientist><i>12:14 AM.</i>

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.020
<v Scientist><i>I left Ulrich in the chamber to be alone with me.</i>

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.420
<v Scientist><i>I needed answers.</i>

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.040
<v Scientist>Ulrich, what happened?

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.980
<v Scientist>What did you do?

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.800
<v Ulrich>Hell could not wait for these men.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.700
<v Ulrich>The doctor sicker than his patients.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.800
<v Ulrich>The boy allowing his own kind to perish
on account of his own negligence.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.420
<v Ulrich>The man who blindly follows evil
for the sake of convenience.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:51.800
<v Ulrich>Without the fortitude of unconsciousness,
all men will share this fate.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.480
<v Scientist>What are you?

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.340
<v Ulrich>I'm awake.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.960
<v Ulrich>I'm awake.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:03.440
<v Scientist>Whether or not you believe these men
deserve this fate is irrelevant.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.220
<v Scientist>No man can decide this.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:13.420
<v Scientist>I only hope the world will forgive
my part in this experiment.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:27.920
<v Scientist>What these men did will be forever written in
history but I can still erase what I've done.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:34.720
<v Scientist>End log, June 22nd 1945.
