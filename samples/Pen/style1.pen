#q A new file format for Pylar and the rest of the us.

#p
The .pen file is a variation of the traditional markdown file format that is used for formatting text and creating documents in the Pylar programming language. The .pen file adds additional syntax for defining actions and importing libraries in the Pylar language, including keywords such as 'say', 'ifis', and 'also'. These keywords are used to perform specific tasks or operations in the Pylar language, such as printing output to the console, specifying a condition in an if statement, or defining a variable.

One difference between the .pen file and the traditional markdown (.md) file is that the .pen file includes a numbering system for headings, paragraphs, and other text elements. For example, a heading might be formatted as "#1 Title" or "#2 Subtitle", with the number indicating the level of the heading. This numbering system allows for easier organization and navigation within the .pen document.

Another difference is that the .pen file includes additional formatting options for paragraphs and lists, such as the ability to specify bullet points or numbered lists. These formatting options can be specified by using specific keywords, such as 'bullet' or 'number', followed by the text to be formatted.

Overall, the .pen file format combines the formatting capabilities of traditional markdown with the ability to define actions and import libraries in the Pylar programming language, as well as unique formatting options for headings, paragraphs, and lists.
