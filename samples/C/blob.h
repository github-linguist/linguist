 * Blobs do not contain references to other objects and do not have
 * structured data that needs parsing. However, code may use the
 * "parsed" bit in the struct object for a blob to determine whether
 * its content has been found to actually be available, so
 * parse_blob_buffer() is used (by object.c) to flag that the object
 * has been read successfully from the database.
