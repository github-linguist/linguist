# Grab necessary libraries and define main action
grab stdlib* then say("Hello, world!") now

#
This program uses the 'grab stdlib\* then say("Hello, world!")' syntax to import the 'stdlib' library and define the 'main' action in a single line of code, and the 'now' keyword to indicate that the 'main' action should be run immediately after it is defined.

The 'grab stdlib* then say("Hello, world!")' syntax combines the 'grab' and 'then' keywords to import the 'stdlib' library and define the 'main' action in a single line of code. The 'grab stdlib*' portion imports the entire 'stdlib' library, and the 'then say("Hello, world!")' portion defines the 'main' action, which consists of a single line of code that outputs the 'Hello, world!' message to the console.

Using the 'then' keyword and the 'grab stdlib\* then say("Hello, world!")' syntax to import libraries and define actions in Pylar is a stylistic choice, and does not change the functionality of the program. It simply provides a different way of expressing the same concept.
