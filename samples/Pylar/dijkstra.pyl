# Here is an example of how you could write Dijkstra's algorithm in Pylar:
# Define a graph

let graph = {
"start": {"a": 6, "b": 2},
"a": {"fin": 1},
"b": {"a": 3, "fin": 5},
"fin": {}
}

# Define the costs table

let costs = {
"a": 6,
"b": 2,
"fin": float("inf")
}

# Define the parents table

let parents = {
"a": "start",
"b": "start",
"fin": None
}

# Define a list of processed nodes

let processed = []

# Find the lowest cost node

def find_lowest_cost_node(costs):
lowest_cost = float("inf")
lowest_cost_node = None
for node in costs:
cost = costs[node]
if cost < lowest_cost and node not in processed:
lowest_cost = cost
lowest_cost_node = node
return lowest_cost_node

# Dijkstra's algorithm

do(dijkstra) is

# Find the lowest cost node that you haven't processed yet
node = find_lowest_cost_node(costs)
# If you've processed all the nodes, this while loop is done
while node is not None:
cost = costs[node]
neighbors = graph[node]
for n in neighbors.keys():
new_cost = cost + neighbors[n]
if costs[n] > new_cost:
costs[n] = new_cost
parents[n] = node
processed.append(node)
node = find_lowest_cost_node(costs)
Run Dijkstra's algorithm

dijkstra now

# Print the results

say(costs)
say(parents)

# This Pylar code defines a graph, costs table, and parents table, and then uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the lowest cost path from the start node to the finish node. The 'find_lowest_cost_node' function is used to find the lowest cost node that has not yet been processed, and the 'dijkstra' action is used to run the algorithm. The 'say' action is used to print the results of the algorithm, including the costs table and the parents table.

# Pylar is designed to be easy to read and understand, and is intended to be familiar to people who have experience reading and writing books and literature. It is also designed to be super secure, combining the best parts of Rust and Python to create a new language that is optimized for AI and ML.
